# Light/Dark response Analysis from Viewpoint (Zebrabox) data
This repository will include all the necessary information to analyse the motion data (distance and duration)
generated in the viewpoint Zebrabox system.
The setup of the viewpoint system should include switches between lights on/off. Duration and number of 
such switches are customisable.
