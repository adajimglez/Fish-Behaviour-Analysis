# Light/Dark response Analysis from Viewpoint (Zebrabox) data
This repository will include all the necessary information to analyse the motion data (distance and duration)
generated in the viewpoint Zebrabox system.
The setup of the viewpoint system should include switches between lights on/off. Duration and number of 
such switches are customisable.

## Experimental setup
We perform the behaviour analysis in 96 well plates, with circular wells, in zebrafish larvae from 4 days postfertilisation. 
Each larva is pipetted into individual wells and liquid volume is adjusted to 250 μl.
Our most common light/dark test starts with a 10-minute acclimation period with the lights on and the plate in the viewpoint stage.
After this we start recording swimming activity switching between lights on and off every 5 minutes. 
Data are exported for each well in 1 second time bins.
